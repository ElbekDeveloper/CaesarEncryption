# Caesar Encryption

This is small project to practice arrays and loops.
Here are what you can do to improve the project:

- The app doesn’t work with uppercase letters. Fix that by converting any message to lowercase.
- The app doesn’t work with symbols, like ! or ?. Skip any symbols in your loop so that they are not encrypted.
- Rewrite the loop as a method Encrypt() which takes a character array and key and returns an encrypted character array .
- Write a Decrypt() method which takes a character array and key and returns a decrypted character array.
